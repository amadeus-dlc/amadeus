# AI-DLC State Tracking

## Project Information
- **Project**: Implement issue #1396: first-class archived intent status with mis-resume guard. Enum the registry status vocabulary (in-flight/parked/complete/archived) aligned with the #1309 lifecycle-record contract, make the engine loudly refuse cursor selection, next, and unpark on archived intents (explicit user-approved override verb only), migrate 260713-swarm-driver-migration to archived per its closure-note, and include falling proof. https://github.com/amadeus-dlc/amadeus/issues/1396
